3. remember delegate preserves visible variable state during recomposition.            

True or False

True. In Jetpack Compose, the remember delegate can be used to preserve the state of a variable across recompositions. This can be particularly useful for maintaining the state of a variable even when the composable function is recomposed, ensuring that the variable's state is retained between recomposition cycles. So, the statement is true.
